philanthropy.metrics._fairness
==============================
Lightweight fairness diagnostics for scored donor cohorts.

Wealth- and capacity-based features (estimated net worth, real-estate value,
geography) can act as proxies for protected characteristics, so a model that
never sees a protected attribute can still produce disparate outcomes. These
functions are **diagnostics, not guarantees**: they surface disparity so a human
can investigate it — they do not certify a model as fair or legally compliant.
See ``docs/explanation/compliance_considerations.md``.

    """Four-fifths-rule disparate-impact ratio across protected groups.

    Computes ``min(selection_rate) / max(selection_rate)`` over the groups in
    ``sensitive_features``. A value of ``1.0`` is exact parity; the US EEOC
    "four-fifths rule" flags a ratio below ``0.8`` as evidence of adverse impact
    that warrants investigation.

    This is a **diagnostic, not a fairness guarantee or legal clearance** — a
    passing ratio does not certify a model as non-discriminatory, and the choice
    of protected groups and decision threshold materially affects the result.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_pred : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Binary decisions. Threshold continuous scores first.
    sensitive_features : array-like of shape (n_samples,)
        Protected-group label per sample.
    pos_label : default=1

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Ratio in ``[0.0, 1.0]``. Returns ``1.0`` when only one group is present
        or when no sample in any group is selected (no disparity to measure).
